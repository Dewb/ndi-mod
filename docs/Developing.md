## Building from source

to build and copy into ~/dust/code:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will also create `ndi-mod.zip` in `build`. Copy this to a GitHub release page (or other URL) for distribution via maiden.

## NDI resources

The NDI SDK documentation PDF is essential reading.Unfortunately it is not directly available on the NewTek site, but it's included in the [NDI SDK download](https://ndi.tv/sdk/).

The [NDI Developer Zone](https://forums.newtek.com/forums/ndi-developer-zone.363/) forum might also be helpful.
