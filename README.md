## ndi-mod for norns

norns system mod to share the screen via the [NDI](https://streamgeeks.us/what-is-ndi/) streaming video protocol.

## why ndi / why not ndi?

NDI is fast and supports easy discovery and configuration in popular tools like [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) and [Resolume](https://resolume.com/).

It has the disadvantage of being not an open standard (but it is at least royalty-free.)

## todo

- [X] ~~basic scaffolding~~
- [X] ~~proof of concept: send a static 128x64 test card from norns~~
- [X] ~~mvp: send a screen buffer from a manual lua call in `redraw()`~~
- [X] ~~send screen buffer automatically on every script redraw
- [ ] stretch: catch every update including menus (partial success, grabs menus after first script load. might need new mod hook?)
- [X] documentation
- [ ] demo video

## how to use

### installing

1. From the maiden console, enter:
   ```
   ;install https://github.com/Dewb/ndi-mod/releases/download/latest/ndi-mod.zip
   ```
2. In the norns menu, navigate to to **SYSTEM > MODS**, scroll to **NDI-MOD**, and turn enc 3
   clockwise to add a `+` next to the mod name. Hit button 2 to back out and select
   **SYSTEM > RESTART** to relaunch with the mod loaded.

beware: this is a proof of concept, does not work reliably yet!

temporary requirement: manual invocation from script:
* call `ndi_mod.start()` in `init()` (or at the maiden console)
* call `ndi_mod.update()` in `redraw()` (or at the maiden console) to send the current screen surface as a NDI frame

### viewing NDI output on your desktop (PC/Mac/Linux)

The NDI Studio Monitor tool included in NDI Tools can view and record NDI streams.

1. Install the [NDI Tools](https://ndi.tv/tools/). (This requires giving an e-mail address to NewTek.)
2. Run the NDI Studio Monitor and click the three-lines icon in the upper left corner.
3. You should see **NORNS** in the sources list, click it and select **norns screen** from the flyout.

### using with OBS Studio (PC/Mac/Linux)

OBS Studio is a great open-source tool for streaming or recording video from a variety of sources at once.

1. Install [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).
2. Install the [NDI plugin for OBS Studio](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases).
3. The obs-ndi plugin hasn't been updated in a while and can be finicky. Notably, it's built with an older version of the NDI Tools. You may need to *re-install* the OBS 5 tools after running the obs-ndi installer. Try the OBS forums for more advice if you have trouble.
4. Run OBS Studio. If you get a firewall prompt (Windows) allow OBS to contact devices on the local network.
5. Click the plus below the **Sources** list to add a new source. **NDI Source** should be in the list. Select it and then hit **OK**.
6. In the Properties window, click the **Source Name** dropdown and choose **NORNS**.
8. Hit **OK**. You should see the norns screen show up in the canvas. Click and drag the window and its corner controls to move and resize it.

Tips:
* Right-click the screen element and set **Scale Filtering** to **Point** to keep your pixels blocky.
* If you want to overlay the screen over your webcam or other video sources:
   * Select the source in the **Sources** list, click **Filters**, click the plus under **Effect Filters**, and choose **Luma Key**.
   * Set **Luma Max** to `1.0`, **Luma Min** to `0.002`, and both **Smooth** values to `0.0`.
* In the **Properties** for the NDI source, try changing **Latency Mode** to **Low (experimental)**.
* Add a **Color Correction** filter and adjust **Gamma**, **Brightness**, and **Color Add** to adjust the color palette of the graphics.

### using with Resolume Avenue/Arena

1. Start Resolume. If you get a firewall prompt (Windows) allow Resolume to contact devices on the local network.
2. Scroll to the end of the **Sources** tab; you should see **NORNS** listed under the **NDI SERVERS** heading. Drag it into a clip.

Tips:
   * To overlay the norns screen over other video, add an **Auto Mask** effect to the norns screen clip and set the **Contrast** all the way up to 1. A **Bright.Contrast** effect before and/or after **Auto Mask** will allow you to fine tune the results.
   * To get an "animated text" effect, put the norns screen clip in a layer set to the **50 Mask** blend mode. Again, adding a **Bright.Contrast** effect to the clip will allow you to tune the results.

### using with mobile devices

*iOS*
* Install [NDI Monitor by Sienna/Mark Gilbert](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ndi-monitor/id1196221514) from the App Store ($9.99).
* Run it and grant permissions to contact devices on your network.
* Select **NORNS** from the list of detected sources.

*Android*
* No known solution yet
