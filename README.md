streaming video protocol.

## why ndi / why not ndi?

NDI is fast, and supports easy discovery of stream sources. Support for NDI is built in
or available via plugin in several popular streaming and VJ tools like [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
and [Resolume](https://resolume.com/).

It has the disadvantage of being not an open standard (but it is at least royalty-free.)

In low-latency mode, a NDI stream over the local network is less than a frame behind the norns screen. So far, in informal testing with a Pi CM3+ factory norns, using this mod increases the CPU load by just 1-2%.

Alternatives to NDI include RTMP, HLS, or SRT; those may be better for certain purposes and the general structure of this mod could be adapted to other protocols. 

# how to use

### installing and activating

1. From the maiden console, enter:
   ```
   ;install https://github.com/Dewb/ndi-mod/releases/download/latest/ndi-mod.zip
   ```
2. In the norns menu, navigate to to **SYSTEM > MODS**, scroll to **NDI-MOD**, and turn enc 3
   clockwise to add a `+` next to the mod name. Hit button 2 to back out, and select
   **SYSTEM > RESTART** to relaunch with the mod loaded.

### viewing NDI output on your desktop (PC/Mac/Linux)

The NDI Studio Monitor tool included in NDI Tools can view and record NDI streams.

1. Install the [NDI Tools](https://ndi.tv/tools/). (This requires giving an e-mail address to NewTek.)
2. Run the NDI Studio Monitor and click the three-lines icon in the upper left corner.
3. You should see **NORNS** in the sources list, click it and select **norns screen** from the flyout.

### using with OBS Studio (PC/Mac/Linux)

1. Install [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).
2. Install the [NDI plugin for OBS Studio](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases).
3. The obs-ndi plugin hasn't been updated in a while and can be finicky. Notably, it's built with an older version of the NDI Tools. You may need to *re-install* the OBS 5 tools after running the obs-ndi installer. Try the OBS forums for more advice if you have trouble.
4. Run OBS Studio. If you get a firewall prompt (Windows) allow OBS to contact devices on the local network.
5. Click the plus below the **Sources** list to add a new source. **NDI Source** should be in the list. Select it and then hit **OK**.
6. In the Properties window, click the **Source Name** dropdown and choose **NORNS**.
8. Hit **OK**. You should see the norns screen show up in the canvas. Click and drag the window and its corner controls to move and resize it.

Tips:
* Right-click the screen element and set **Scale Filtering** to **Point** to keep your pixels blocky.
* If you want to overlay the screen over your webcam or other video sources:
   * Select the source in the **Sources** list, click **Filters**, click the plus under **Effect Filters**, and choose **Luma Key**.
   * Set **Luma Max** to `1.0`, **Luma Min** to `0.002`, and both **Smooth** values to `0.0`.
* In the **Properties** for the NDI source, try changing **Latency Mode** to **Low (experimental)**.
* Add a **Color Correction** filter and adjust **Gamma**, **Brightness**, and **Color Add** to adjust the color palette of the graphics.

## using with Resolume Avenue/Arena (PC/Mac)

1. Start Resolume. If you get a firewall prompt (Windows) allow Resolume to contact devices on the local network.
2. Scroll to the end of the **Sources** tab; you should see **NORNS** listed under the **NDI SERVERS** heading. Drag it into a clip.

Tips:
   * To overlay the norns screen over other video, add an **Auto Mask** effect to the norns screen clip and set the **Contrast** all the way up to 1. A **Bright.Contrast** effect before and/or after **Auto Mask** will allow you to fine tune the results.
   * To get an "animated text" effect, put the norns screen clip in a layer set to the **50 Mask** blend mode. Again, adding a **Bright.Contrast** effect to the clip will allow you to tune the results.

### using with mobile devices

*iOS*
* Install [NDI Monitor by Sienna/Mark Gilbert](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ndi-monitor/id1196221514) from the App Store ($9.99).
* Run it and grant permissions to contact devices on your network.
* Select **NORNS** from the list of detected sources.

## advanced usage

### control via maiden and scripts

When the mod is active, the NDI server is always running and sending video. You can customize the behavior with the following Lua methods:
* `ndi_mod.stop()` will stop sending video
* `ndi_mod.start()` will start sending video
* `ndi_mod.send_frame()` will send a single frame, regardless of the start/stop state

### building from source

to build and copy into ~/dust/code:

```bash
