## norns-ndi-mod

norns system mod to share screen via the [NDI](https://streamgeeks.us/what-is-ndi/) streaming video standard. 

## why ndi / why not ndi?

NDI has the advantages of easy discovery and configuration in popular tools like [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) and [Resolume](https://resolume.com/). 

It has the disadvantage of being not an open standard (but it is at least royalty-free.)

## todo

- [X] ~~basic scaffolding~~
- [X] ~~proof of concept: send a static 128x64 test card from norns~~
- [ ] mvp: send a screen buffer from a manual lua call in `redraw()`
- [ ] stretch: send screen buffer automatically on every update (likely will require core changes to add a new mod hook for screen pre-draw)
- [ ] documentation & demo video

## how to use

*TODO: instructions for end user install. goals: no external dependencies via apt/etc., installable via maiden ;install command*
