a [norns](https://monome.org/norns) mod to share the contents of the LCD screen in near-real-time via the [NDI](https://streamgeeks.us/what-is-ndi/) streaming video protocol.

## why ndi / why not ndi?

NDI is fast, and includes zeroconf-based discovery of stream sources. Many popular streaming and video art tools support discovering and receiving NDI streams, including [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)\*, [Resolume](https://resolume.com/), and [Max/MSP/Jitter](https://cycling74.com/products/max-features)\*, and [Touch Designer](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/NDI).

(*\* requires a plugin*)

Using NDI's standard latency mode, a stream over a local wi-fi network is about a frame behind the norns screen. So far, in informal testing with a Pi CM3+ factory norns, using this mod appears to increase the CPU load by just 1-2%. When using clients like OBS that support NDI's optional low-latency mode, the network update can be almost simultaneous with the norns screen update.

One disadvantage of NDI is that it's not a completely open, unencumbered standard (but it is at least royalty-free.)

Alternatives to NDI include RTMP, HLS, or SRT; those may be better for certain purposes and the general structure of this mod could be adapted to other protocols. 

# how to use

## installing and activating

1. From the maiden console, enter:
   ```
   ;install https://github.com/Dewb/ndi-mod/releases/download/latest/ndi-mod.zip
   ```
2. In the norns menu, navigate to to **SYSTEM > MODS**, scroll to **NDI-MOD**, and turn enc 3
   clockwise to add a `+` next to the mod name. Hit button 2 to back out, and select
   **SYSTEM > RESTART** to relaunch with the mod loaded.
   
This will add about 6MB of files to `~/dust/code/ndi-mod`. To uninstall everything, go to the maiden library, scroll to `ndi-mod` in the installed section, and click **remove**.
