## norns-ndi-mod

norns system mod to share screen via the [NDI](https://streamgeeks.us/what-is-ndi/) streaming video standard. 

## why ndi / why not ndi?

NDI has the advantages of easy discovery and configuration in popular tools like [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) and [Resolume](https://resolume.com/). 

It has the disadvantage of being not an open standard (but it is at least royalty-free.)
