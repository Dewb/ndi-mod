# ndi-mod for norns

a [norns](https://monome.org/norns) mod to share the screen in near-real-time via the [NDI](https://streamgeeks.us/what-is-ndi/) 
streaming video protocol.

## why ndi / why not ndi?

NDI is fast, and includes zeroconf-based discovery of stream sources. Many popular streaming and video art tools support discovering and receiving NDI streams, including [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)\*, 
[Resolume](https://resolume.com/), and [Max/MSP/Jitter](https://cycling74.com/products/max-features)\*, and [Touch Designer](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/NDI).

(*\* requires a plugin*)

Using NDI's standard latency mode, a stream over a local wi-fi network is about a frame behind the norns screen. So far, in informal testing with a Pi CM3+ factory norns, using this mod appears to increase the CPU load by just 1-2%. When using clients like OBS that support NDI's optional low-latency mode, the network update can be almost simultaneous with the norns screen update.

One disadvantage of NDI is that it's not a completely open, unencumbered standard (but it is at least royalty-free.)

Alternatives to NDI include RTMP, HLS, or SRT; those may be better for certain purposes and the general structure of this mod could be adapted to other protocols. 

# how to use

### installing and activating

1. From the maiden console, enter:
   ```
   ;install https://github.com/Dewb/ndi-mod/releases/download/latest/ndi-mod.zip
   ```
2. In the norns menu, navigate to to **SYSTEM > MODS**, scroll to **NDI-MOD**, and turn enc 3
   clockwise to add a `+` next to the mod name. Hit button 2 to back out, and select
   **SYSTEM > RESTART** to relaunch with the mod loaded.
   
This will add about 6MB of files to `~/dust/code/ndi-mod`. To uninstall everything, go to the maiden library, scroll to `ndi-mod` in the installed section, and click **remove**.

## general tips

* norns should show up as "**NORNS** (norns screen)" in any NDI-supporting app or device that can reach norns through the network. NDI 5 support is best, but NDI 4 apps might also be able to connect.
* If, in any program, you see local NDI sources but you don't see **NORNS**, make sure the app is allowed through any firewalls, and restart the app.
* 

### viewing NDI output on your desktop (PC/Mac/Linux)

The NDI Studio Monitor tool included in NDI Tools can view and record NDI streams.

1. Install the [NDI Tools](https://ndi.tv/tools/). (This requires giving an e-mail address to NewTek.)
2. Run the NDI Studio Monitor and click the three-lines icon in the upper left corner.
3. You should see **NORNS** in the sources list, click it and select **norns screen** from the flyout.

### using with OBS Studio (PC/Mac/Linux)

1. Install [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).
2. Install the [NDI plugin for OBS Studio](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases).
3. Install the [the latest NDI Tools](https://ndi.tv/tools/). (NOTE: The Windows installer will install version 4 of the tools, so if you'd already installed them previously you may need to *re-install* NDI 5 after running the plugin installer. If you install the OBS plugin with the Windows .zip build, or the MacOS or Linux builds, you should only need to install the NDI 5 Tools once.)
5. Run OBS Studio. If you get a firewall prompt (Windows) allow OBS to contact devices on the local network.
6. Click the plus below the **Sources** list to add a new source. **NDIâ„¢ Source** should be in the list. Select it and then hit **OK**.
7. In the Properties window, click the **Source Name** dropdown and choose **NORNS**.
8. Hit **OK**. You should see the norns screen show up in the canvas. Click and drag the window and its corner controls to move and resize it.
9. *Optional but recommended*:
   * To keep your pixels crisp and blocky, right-click the NDI source and set **Scale Filtering** to **Point**.
   * For the best performance, open the **Properties** window for the NDI source, scroll down to **Latency Mode** and change it to **Low (experimental)**. 

Tips:
* If you want to overlay the screen over your webcam or other video sources:
   * Select the source in the **Sources** list, click **Filters**, click the plus under **Effect Filters**, and choose **Luma Key**.
   * Set **Luma Max** to `1.0`, **Luma Min** to `0.002`, and both **Smooth** values to `0.0`.
* If you want to adjust the brightness levels (which are going to have a different curve than the norns hardware screen) add a **Color Correction** filter and adjust **Gamma**, **Brightness**. To turn the grayscale palette into a color gradient, try **Color Add** in the Color Correction filter or add a **Apply LUT** filter.

## using with Resolume Avenue/Arena (PC/Mac)

1. Start Resolume. If you get a firewall prompt (Windows) allow Resolume to contact devices on the local network.
2. Scroll to the end of the **Sources** tab; you should see **NORNS** listed under the **NDI SERVERS** heading. Drag it into a clip.
3. For more information, [read the NDI section of the Resolume documentation](https://resolume.com/support/en/NDI_inputs_and_outputs).
Tips:
   * To overlay the norns screen over other video, add an **Auto Mask** effect to the norns screen clip and set the **Contrast** all the way up to 1. A **Bright.Contrast** effect before and/or after **Auto Mask** will allow you to fine tune the results.
   * To get an "animated text" effect, put the norns screen clip in a layer set to the **50 Mask** blend mode. Again, adding a **Bright.Contrast** effect to the clip will allow you to tune the results.

### using with Max/MSP/Jitter (requires Max 8.2.0 or later)

1. Install the [jit.ndi](https://github.com/pixsper/jit.ndi) package following [the instructions in its README](https://github.com/pixsper/jit.ndi#installation).
2. Run Max. Add a `jit.ndi.receive~` object. Right-click the object and choose **Open jit.ndi.receive~ Help**.
3. In the help/example patch, follow the numbered instructions to **Select an NDI source** (choose NORNS) and **Toggle on qmetro.** You should see the norns screen in the output object.

### using with Touch Designer (version 2022.20000 or later recommended)

1. Run Touch Designer. Hit **Tab** to add an operator, choose the **TOP** tab, and add an **NDI In** operator. 
2. If you get a firewall prompt (Windows) allow TD to contact devices on the local network.
3. In the properties of the **NDI In** operator, change **Source Name** to **NORNS**.
4. You should see the norns screen inside the NDI operator. For more information, read the [NDI section in the Touch Designer user guide](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/NDI).

### using with mobile devices

*iOS*

1. Install [NDI Monitor by Sienna/Mark Gilbert](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ndi-monitor/id1196221514) from the App Store ($9.99).
2. Run it and grant permissions to contact devices on your network.
3. Select **NORNS** from the list of detected sources.

## advanced usage

### control via maiden and scripts

When the mod is active, the NDI server is always running and sending video. You can customize the behavior with the following Lua methods:
* `ndi_mod.stop()` will stop sending video
* `ndi_mod.start()` will start sending video
* `ndi_mod.send_frame()` will send a single frame, regardless of the start/stop state

### building from source

to build and copy into ~/dust/code:

```bash
./build.sh
```
